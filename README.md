# emotional-selloff-eventstudy
🎯 Portfolio Project Overview

This project bridges data science, financial modeling, and behavioral finance — showcasing both technical capability and real-world economic insight.

💡 What It Demonstrates

Data Analysis & Feature Engineering: Aggregated multi-decade stock and benchmark data to detect 10%+ month-over-month market declines.

Machine Learning Foundations: Created event-driven return modeling to compare “hold” vs. “panic-sell” strategies — a precursor to predictive behavioral analytics.

Python & Pandas Proficiency: Built reusable Python modules (src/) for data ingestion, return computation, and event-driven backtesting.

Statistical Thinking: Measured outcomes using t-tests, abnormal return analysis, and cumulative performance comparisons.

Automation Readiness: Modular structure allows integration with AI-based sentiment models (e.g., FinBERT) for future emotional-selloff detection.

🧠 Behavioral Finance Angle

Emotional Bias Quantified: Translating investor behavior (loss aversion, herd mentality) into measurable performance drag.

Rational vs. Emotional Investing: Demonstrates the real-world cost of following “fear-driven” selling patterns.

Actionable Insight: Reinforces long-term holding discipline with historical, data-backed evidence.

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages & Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Jupyter

Data Sources: FAANG price data, S&P 500 benchmark (SPY)

Methodology: Event Study + Backtesting Simulation

🚀 Why It Stands Out

This project isn’t just data wrangling — it’s a demonstration of financial psychology applied through code. It connects your behavioral finance background with modern data analysis techniques, making it an ideal GitHub showcase for:

Customer Success / Account Management roles (data-driven storytelling)

Sales Enablement or Fintech positions (bridging finance + analytics)

Technical roles (automation, reproducibility, and documentation discipline)
